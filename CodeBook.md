The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals timeAccelerometer a-XYZ and timeGyroscope-XYZ. These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (timeBodyacceleration-XYZ and timeGravityAcceleration-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (timeBodyAccelerationJerk-XYZ and timeBodyGyroscopeJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (timeBodyAccelerationMagnitude, timeGravityAccelerationMagnitude, timeBodyAccelerationJerkMagnitude, timeBodyGyroscopeMagnitude, timeBodyGyroscopeJerkMagnitude).

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcceleration-XYZ, frequencyBodyAccelerationJerk-XYZ, frequencyBodyGyro-XYZ, frequencyBodyAccelerationJerkMagnitude, frequencyBodyGyroMagnitude, frequencyBodyGyroJerkMagnitude.

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
